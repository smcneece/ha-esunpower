- **Minimum Polling**: Increased from 60s to 300s (5 minutes) for PVS hardware protection.

**Migration Guide:**
```yaml
# OLD automation (will break):
- condition: state
  entity_id: binary_sensor.sunpower_pvs_state  
  state: "working"

# NEW automation (Enhanced SunPower):
- condition: state
  entity_id: binary_sensor.sunpower_pvs_state
  state: "on"
```

**Disclaimers:**
- Extensively tested on a 30-panel SunPower system **without batteries**. Battery system users welcome to test and provide feedback.
- You assume all risk using this integration. It accesses unofficial PVS APIs not intended for continuous monitoring.

### Monitoring Approach Recommendations

**For 24/7 Full-Time Monitoring:**

**Utility Smart Meter (Best Accuracy)**
- Direct utility company integration where available
- Real-time production/consumption data
- Grid-tied accuracy for billing reconciliation

**Dedicated CT Energy Monitor (Recommended)**
For comprehensive whole-home monitoring, we recommend dedicated current transformer (CT) systems:

**[SEM-Meter (Smart Home Energy Meter)](https://www.amazon.com/Energy-Monitor-Circuit-Sensors-Real-Time/dp/B0F5QCB1X9)** *(Developer Tested)*
- **Whole house**: ~$100 for main monitoring
- **Circuit-level**: ~$125 for 16 individual circuits  
- **100% Local Operation** - No cloud dependency required
- **Direct HA integration** via MQTT
- **Real-time updates** (1-second intervals)
- **Professional installation** recommended for CT clamps

*This monitor is used and recommended by the integration developer for production reliability.*

**Enhanced SunPower Role**
- **Individual inverter diagnostics** - Per-panel performance monitoring
- **PVS system health** - Firmware tracking, error detection, communication monitoring
- **Equipment maintenance** - Temperature monitoring, MPPT analysis, inverter health tracking
- **Solar-specific metrics** - Frequency analysis, power factor, voltage regulation
- **System reliability** - Integration performance and diagnostic monitoring
- **Network troubleshooting** - Route status and automatic setup/repair capabilities
- **Sunrise/sunset optimization** - Panel-specific polling schedules

**Why Separate Monitoring Systems?**

**Energy Monitor Strengths:**
- Real-time data (1-second updates)
- Continuous reliability (purpose-built for 24/7 operation)  
- Energy Dashboard optimized (designed for utility-scale accuracy)
- Whole-home coverage (beyond just solar)

**Enhanced SunPower Strengths:**
- Equipment diagnostics (individual component health)
- PVS integration (official system monitoring)
- Environmental data (temperatures, frequencies)
- Maintenance alerts (firmware updates, communication errors)
- Inverter health tracking (individual panel monitoring)
- MPPT monitoring (DC-side performance analysis)
- Integration reliability (diagnostic dashboard monitoring)
- Network intelligence (route detection, setup, and repair)
- Panel optimization (sunrise/sunset elevation control)

**Together:** Complete solar installation monitoring from grid-level accuracy down to individual panel performance, network connectivity, and panel-specific scheduling.

**Polling Frequency:** Enhanced SunPower polls every 5-10 minutes (300-600 seconds), which is perfectly adequate for energy statistics and equipment monitoring. This protects your PVS hardware while providing comprehensive solar system insights.

## Network Setup

**CRITICAL**: The PVS LAN port runs its own DHCP/DNS services and **MUST BE ISOLATED** from your main network to prevent conflicts.

**Community Solutions:**
- **VLAN Isolation** (Recommended for managed switches) - Auto route setup/repair supported
- **Raspberry Pi Proxy** (Popular community solution)
- **Dedicated Network Interface** (Direct connection approach)

**For detailed network setup guidance**, see [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) and [@krbaker's documentation](https://github.com/krbaker/hass-sunpower#network-setup).

## Troubleshooting

**Quick Fixes:**
- **PVS Not Responding**: Check network connectivity, verify IP address (`172.27.153.1`)
- **All Entities Unavailable**: Force browser refresh (Ctrl+F5 / Cmd+Shift+R) to clear cached files
- **Diagnostic Sensors Not Working**: Wait for a few polling cycles, check "Enhanced SunPower Diagnostics" device
- **Mobile Notifications Not Working**: Verify Home Assistant mobile app installed and mobile service configured

**For detailed troubleshooting**: See [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
