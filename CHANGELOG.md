### Major Features
- **Entity Naming Compatibility**: Fixed energy dashboard entity naming to show proper inverter identification
- **Professional Documentation**: Enhanced README with 80% emoji reduction for credible presentation
- **Config Flow Improvements**: Added naming options to Basic Settings page with backward compatibility

### Bug Fixes
- **Config Flow Submit Button**: Fixed missing variable definitions preventing successful configuration
- **Naming Options**: Restored `use_descriptive_names` and `use_product_names` functionality
- **Energy Dashboard**: Now shows proper "Inverter E001221370442207 Lifetime Power" format

## [v2025.8.7] - 2025-08-07

### Major Features
- **Sunrise/Sunset Elevation Split**: Separate thresholds for morning and evening optimization
- **Panel Orientation Support**: Perfect for east/west-facing panel installations
