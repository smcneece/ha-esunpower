# Changelog

All notable changes to the Enhanced SunPower Home Assistant Integration will be documented in this file.

## [unreleased]

> **Note**: v2025.9.2 was released but had buggy day/night transition behavior (stuck in wrong polling modes). Rolled back to stable v2025.8.26 and rebuilt the features properly with comprehensive testing.

### üÜï Major Features
- **Dynamic Day/Night Polling**: Complete redesign of polling interval management
  - **Daytime Polling Interval**: 300-3600 seconds for solar production monitoring
  - **Nighttime Polling Interval**: 0 (disabled) or 300-3600 seconds for consumption tracking
  - **Real-time Interval Switching**: Coordinator dynamically adjusts based on sun elevation
  - **Perfect for consumption monitoring** when solar panels aren't producing

### ‚ö†Ô∏è BREAKING CHANGES
- **Removed "Battery System" Toggle**: Replaced with automatic battery detection + separate nighttime interval
- **Automatic Migration**: Existing configurations are automatically updated on restart
  - `has_battery_system: true` ‚Üí `nighttime_polling_interval: <same_as_daytime>`
  - `has_battery_system: false` ‚Üí `nighttime_polling_interval: 0` (disabled)

### üîß Technical Improvements
- **Automatic Battery Detection**: Batteries detected from actual PVS device data, no manual toggle needed
- **Dynamic Coordinator Interval**: Home Assistant coordinator itself changes intervals in real-time
- **Enhanced Config Validation**: Prevents dangerous intervals (<300s) that could harm PVS hardware
- **Smart Battery Logic**: Battery systems use appropriate day/night intervals while maintaining 24/7 monitoring

### üêõ Bug Fixes
- **Fixed Battery Interval Logic**: Battery systems now properly use day/night intervals instead of always using daytime
- **Fixed Virtual Production Meter**: Removed erroneous "KWh To Home" sensor that always showed 0
- **Fixed Config Validation**: Nighttime intervals properly validated (0 or ‚â•300 seconds)
- **Fixed Battery Auto-Detection**: Tuple unpacking bug that caused false battery detection

### üé® Enhanced Debugging
- **Restored Coordinator Diagnostics**: Shows current/required intervals, mode, and elevation with precise timestamps
- **Improved Polling Notifications**: Correctly shows "Daytime/Nighttime/Battery" polling status
- **Enhanced Cache Notifications**: Shows current interval setting when using cached data
- **Better Mode Detection**: Clear differentiation between day, night, battery, and disabled modes

## [v2025.9.2] - 2025-01-15 [REMOVED]

> **Status**: This version was released but had buggy day/night polling transitions (would get stuck in wrong modes). Rolled back to v2025.8.26. All features rebuilt and working correctly in v2025.9.3.

## [v2025.9.1 - 09-13-2025]

### Bug Fixes
- **Virtual Production Meter**: Removed erroneous "KWh to Home" sensor that always showed 0
  - Virtual meters aggregate inverter data and cannot measure consumption direction
  - Reduces sensor clutter and user confusion
  - Real consumption meters still provide accurate bidirectional data

### User Interface Improvements
- **Enhanced Config Flow**: Added clear recommendations for naming options on setup page 2
  - "Use Descriptive Names" now shows "***Strongly recommended***" with improved formatting
  - "Use Product Names" now shows "***Not recommended***" with improved formatting
  
## [v2025.8.26] - 2025-08-29

### Critical Fixes
- **Small System Support**: Reduced minimum device requirement from 10 to 3 devices during setup
- **Proxy Compatibility**: Fixed TCP health checks for reverse proxy setups with custom ports
- **Windows Cache Files**: Fixed cache file creation when using host addresses with ports

### Impact
- Small solar systems (condos, townhomes, EV charging) can now complete setup
- Reverse proxy configurations work without manual intervention
- Cross-platform compatibility improved

## [v2025.8.25] - 2025-08-25

### Critical Fixes
- **Route Repair Retry Logic**: Fixed automatic recovery after route repair - integration now properly retries polling immediately after successful route restoration
- **Enhanced Logging**: Clear messages when route repair triggers automatic retry for better troubleshooting
- **Complete Automation**: No manual reload required after route failures - full hands-off recovery

### Code Maintenance
- **Removed Duplicate Battery Handler Functions**: Eliminated 100+ lines of redundant fallback code (`convert_ess_data_fallback()`, `get_battery_configuration_fallback()`, etc.)
- **Streamlined Battery Support**: Consolidated battery detection logic for better maintainability
- **Improved Code Organization**: Cleaner, more focused codebase structure

### Reliability Improvements
- **Bulletproof Route Handling**: Complete automatic detection, repair, and recovery sequence
- **Faster Recovery Times**: Route repair now triggers immediate polling retry instead of waiting for next cycle
- **Better Error Handling**: Enhanced status tracking for route repair operations
- **System Stability**: Reduced code complexity and memory overhead

## [v2025.9.3] - 2025-09-19

### Code Organization
- **Internal Refactoring**: Moved hardware monitoring functions from `__init__.py` to `health_check.py` for better code organization
- **Flash Memory Monitoring**: `check_flash_memory_level()` now properly located in health check module
- **Firmware Tracking**: `check_firmware_upgrade()` moved to health check module alongside other hardware monitoring
- **Diagnostic Stats**: `update_diagnostic_stats()` relocated to health check module for logical grouping
- **Maintainability**: Reduced `__init__.py` complexity by ~97 lines while preserving all functionality
- **No User Impact**: Internal reorganization only - all features work identically

### Major Features
- **Flash Memory Monitoring**: Critical alerts when PVS flash memory drops below configurable threshold (default: disabled, set MB value to enable)
- **Hardware Protection**: Prevents PVS failures by alerting before flash memory fills up completely
- **Smart Alert Logic**: Daily alert frequency with 5MB escalation (immediate alert if memory drops 5MB+ since last notification)
- **Existing Sensor Integration**: Uses existing "Flash Available" sensor data (KB) with threshold comparison in MB
- **Critical Alert System**: Flash memory alerts sent to both UI notifications and mobile devices (if enabled)
- **Recovery Detection**: Automatic alert reset when memory rises above threshold + 5MB buffer

### Bug Fixes
- **Cache Filename Persistence**: Fixed cache files using integration ID - now uses PVS IP address for consistent filenames across integration reinstalls
- **Route Repairs Diagnostic Sensor**: Fixed "Unavailable" status by correcting config data lookup (route_check_enabled stored in entry.data, not entry.options)
- **Config Flow UI Cleanup**: Removed redundant mobile notifications toggle - mobile device dropdown selection now controls alert sending (select device = enabled, "Disabled" = off)
- **Route Checking Simplification**: Removed separate route checking toggle - now controlled by Gateway IP field (empty = disabled, valid IP = enabled)
- **Config Page Organization**: Moved flash memory threshold to top of notifications page for better field spacing and visual flow
- **Config Flow Text Display**: Fixed missing text and labels on config flow pages 2 & 3 (Solar Configuration and Notifications)
- **Config Flow Organization**: Moved route checking options from Notifications page to Basic Setup page for better logical grouping
- **Translation Coverage**: Added complete translation entries for `solar` and `notifications` config flow steps
